Linear Configuration:
Antennas are arranged in a linear fashion with equal spacing.

Self-Decoupling Features:
- Transmission lines are carefully designed for feeding antennas.
- Isolation techniques (e.g., slot coupling, EBG structures) minimize interference.
- Feeding network controls phase and amplitude for each antenna element.
- Dielectric resonator antenna elements are optimized for frequency bands.
- Mutual coupling is minimized using additional techniques.

Simulation and Validation:
- Electromagnetic simulation tools are used for accurate modeling.
- Iterative optimization ensures effective self-decoupling.
- Real-world testing and measurements validate simulation results.

Conclusion:
This ASCII art representation provides a basic visualization of a linear antenna array with triangular components. For more detailed and accurate visuals, consider using graphical tools or editors.
