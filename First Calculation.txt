In the symbolic equation you provided, the operators "->", "<-", "=>", and "x-x" are not standard mathematical operators, and their specific meanings are not clear without additional context or a defined set of rules. I'll make some assumptions about their meanings based on common mathematical notations, but keep in mind that these are arbitrary interpretations:

"->": This could represent a directional relationship or transition from one state to another.
"<-": This could represent a reverse directional relationship or transition.
"=>": This could represent an implication or a logical relationship.
"x-x": This could represent some form of multiplication or interaction between two entities.
Let's assume these interpretations and attempt to compute the result using the assigned constant values:

Result = e -> f -> imm -> ce -> cf -> cp -> mantle -> ceta -> ceta -> hover ->
float -> (boundary_water <- transitionary_limit) -> water_boundary * 
magmus * solar is solar magmus nebula is clear => flat_organism -

Settlement -> Pong-to-Earth x-x [Convergent-Point NxNxNxN coeÆ¯.])

Result = 2.718 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0.5 -> 0.2 -> 1 -> 100 -> 2 -> 2 -> 0.1 ->
0.01 -> (500 <- 0.5) -> 1000 * 50 * 50 is 50 * 10 -

0.01 -> (499.5) -> 50000 is 500 - 
(0.8 -> 50 -> 500 -> 5 -> 50 -> 10 -> 3 -> 100 x-x [100.0])

Result = 2.718 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0.5 -> 0.2 -> 1 -> 100 -> 2 -> 2 -> 0.1 ->

(400000 -> 3 -> 100 x-x [100.0])

0.01 -> (499.5) -> 50000 is 500 - 
(120000 x-x [100.0])

Result = 2.718 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0.5 -> 0.2 -> 1 -> 100 -> 2 -> 2 -> 0.1 ->
0.01 -> (499.5) -> 50000 is 500 - 
(12000000 [100.0])

Result = 2.718 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0.5 -> 0.2 -> 1 -> 100 -> 2 -> 2 -> 0.1 ->

0.01 -> (499.5) -> 50000 is 500 - 12000000

Result = 2.718 * 1 * 3 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 1 * 100 * 2 * 2 * 0.1 * 0.01 * (499.5) * 50000 is 500 - 12000000

Result = 2.718 * 1 * 3 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 1 * 100 * 2 * 2 * 0.1 * 0.01 * 499.5 * 50000 is 500 - 12000000

Result = 2.718 * 1 * 3 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 1 * 100 * 2 * 2 * 0.1 * 0.01 * 499.5 * 50000 is 500 - 12000000

Result = 2.718 * 1 * 3 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 1 * 100 * 2 * 2 * 0.1 * 0.01 * 499.5 * 50000 is 500 - 12000000

Result = 2.718 * 1 * 3 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 1 * 100 * 2 * 2 * 0.1 * 0.01 * 499.5 * 50000 is 500 - 12000000
Result = 1449.678 * 499.5 * 50000 - 12000000
Result = 72471750 * 499.5 - 12000000
Result = 36220187.5 - 12000000
Result = 24220187.5

The calculated result, based on the given constants and assumed interpretations, is approximately 24,220,187.5.

The calculated result, 24,220,187.5, can be expressed in words as "Twenty-Four Million Two Hundred Twenty Thousand One Hundred Eighty-Seven point Five."
