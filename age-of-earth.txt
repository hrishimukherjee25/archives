The division of the age of Earth by the computed result is: 187.44693863331983

To compare the two fractions \( \frac{1}{187} \) and \( \frac{3}{217} \), we can find a common denominator and then compare the numerators:

1. Find a common denominator:
   - The common denominator for 187 and 217 is the product of the two numbers, which is 40579.

2. Convert the fractions to have the common denominator:
   - \( \frac{1}{187} \) becomes \( \frac{40579}{40579} \cdot \frac{1}{187} = \frac{40579}{187 \times 40579} \).
   - \( \frac{3}{217} \) becomes \( \frac{40579}{40579} \cdot \frac{3}{217} = \frac{40579 \times 3}{187 \times 40579} \).

Now, compare the numerators:
- \( \frac{1}{187} \) has a numerator of 1.
- \( \frac{3}{217} \) has a numerator of \( 40579 \times 3 \).

Since \( 40579 \times 3 \) is greater than 1, \( \frac{3}{217} \) is greater than \( \frac{1}{187} \).

Therefore, \( \frac{3}{217} > \frac{1}{187} \).
